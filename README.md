# I no longer own this device.
**I'm happy to accepts PR's, but I won't be able to develop and test changes myself. If you want to take over the development, let me know.**

# Intro
This is a custom component for Home Assistant to get the readings from a Kamstrup Multical 66C meter.

![Dashboard group](group.png)

According to the docs ([attached](5511-%20634%20GB%20Rev%20C1.qxd.pdf)) this might also work on the 66D and 66E versions. I was not able to test this, in case you've got one of these meters and want to give it a try, I would like to hear back from you.
For more technical details about the communication with the meter, you might want to check out pages 33-36. I also found page 9 with the units interesting.

# Requirements
To use this component, you'll need a cable with an IR read/write head and connect your machine running Home Assistant directly to the IR sensor of the Kamstrup meter.
The one from [Volkszaehler.org](https://wiki.volkszaehler.org/hardware/controllers/ir-schreib-lesekopf) seems to work fine, but might be hard to get.
The read/write head looks like this:

# Installation
There are a few ways you can install this custom component into your Home Assistant.
A solution I quite often see, is to manually copy all the files from [custom_components/mc66c/](custom_components/mc66c/) folder to your `<home_assistant_path>/config/custom_components/mc66c/`

A better way would be to check out this git repository in your Home Assistant.
eg. into a folder called `external`. So `<home_assistant_path>/config/external` and then create a symbolic link for the custom component:
```bash
cd <home_assistant_path>/config/custom_components
ln -s ../external/Home-Assistant-Sensor-MC66C/custom_components/mc66c mc66c
```
Doing this allows you to update the files easily from this repo.
```bash
cd <home_assistant_path>/external/Home-Assistant-Sensor-MC66C
git pull
```

# Configuration
Before you add the configuration, make sure you have added all the files and have restarted your Home Assistant.

Also, there are many ways to add this sensor to your configuration. You can add the bellow `sensor` and (optional) `group` from the example below directly to your `configuration.yaml` file.
The way I prefer doing this is making use of the [packages](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/) approach.
In that case you could use the following configuration in `<home_assistant_path>/packages/stadsverwarming.yaml`
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: mc66c
    name: Stadsverwarming
    port: /dev/ttyUSB1
    scan_interval: 30
    resources:
      - energy
      - volume
      - op_hrs
      - temperature_in
      - temperature_out
      - temperature_diff
      - power
      - flow
      - peak_power
      - info_code

group:
  mc66c:
    name: Stadsverwarming meter
    entities:
      - sensor.stadsverwarming_energy
      - sensor.stadsverwarming_volume
      - sensor.stadsverwarming_operating_hours
      - sensor.stadsverwarming_temperature_in
      - sensor.stadsverwarming_temperature_out
      - sensor.stadsverwarming_temperature_difference
      - sensor.stadsverwarming_power
      - sensor.stadsverwarming_peak_power
      - sensor.stadsverwarming_flow
```
## Configuration variables
This component has the following configuration variables:
```yaml
platform: mc66c
```
 This is required, to use this platform for the sensor. You can't change this.

```yaml
name: Stadsverwarming
```
This is optional, the name will be used to prefix the sensors, `mc66c` will be used if the name is specified.

```yaml
port: /dev/ttyUSB1
```
This is required, the port that has the IR cable, note if you use docker, that you have to expose this device to the container.

```yaml
scan_interval: 30
```
This is optional, the seconds that the sensor will check for updates, 30 is the default.

```yaml
resources: list
```
This is optional, however an empty list (the default) will result in no sensors being created. Only the sensors that are being listed will be created. Possible values are:
- `energy` - Energy usage in `GJ`
- `volume` - Volume in `M3`
- `op_hrs` - Operating hours, using unit `hrs`
- `temperature_in` - Temperature in, in `°C`
- `temperature_out` - Temperature out in `°C`
- `temperature_diff` - difference in temperatures in `°C`
- `power` - Power usage in `kW`
- `peak_power` - Peak power in `kWp`

### Logging
```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.mc66c: info
```

# Feedback
If you're facing any issues or have feedback or a request, feel free to raise an issue and I'll see what I can do. I've to admit I'm not very familiar with `python`, however, I'll try my best to make this component work for everyone. I'm also happy to accept any PR with fixes/improvements.

# Thank you!
[Jurgen](https://tweakers.net/gallery/92058/) on Tweakers, [pointing out the cable](https://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_message/62338462#62338462) needed for this to project to work.

[@RuntimeError123](https://github.com/RuntimeError123) for his [integration using MQTT](https://github.com/RuntimeError123/hass-mc66c), it helped me a lot setting up this custom component. If you're looking for a solution where the cable and Home Assistant are not running on the same machine, I recommend using his implementation.
